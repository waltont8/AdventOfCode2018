https://adventofcode.com/2018<br>
I didn't know about Advent of code in 2018 so going back to have a look at the puzzles<br>

--- Day 1: Chronal Calibration ---   <br>
--- Day 2: Inventory Management System ---   <br>
--- Day 3: No Matter How You Slice It ---   <br>
    Playing around with attoparsec. Takes a few seconds to run, but would have taken a few minutes to write a faster one<br>
--- Day 4: Repose Record ---<br>
    This took ages. Nothing difficult, just felt like a lot of shuffling around<br>
--- Day 5: Alchemical Reduction ---<br>
    There are only 26 answers, just try them all<br>
